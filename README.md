# scoctoloc

The use of a *global* associator in scautoloc makes it suitable for locating seismic events world-wide, because it is able to associate events using tricks specifically tuned to work with teleseismic pick data.
For smaller networks, when locating seismic events at a *regional* or even *local* scale, a lot of what scautoloc does is unneeded and is in fact overkill.

This is where scoctoloc comes into play.
It uses the very efficient PyOcto associator, hence the name 'scoctoloc'.

scoctoloc is the scautoloc sibling for *small* networks of up to approximately 800 km.
In fact it is meant to replace scautoloc in regional/local monitoring setups.


## Main use cases

There are three main use cases for scoctoloc:

- Real-time (online) mode with pick data arriving via messaging.
  This is what most users will use scoctoloc for.
- Offline mode with bulk parametric data read either from database or XML.
  Could be the post-processing of data from a temporary experiment.
- Offline playback mode that simulates real-time behaviour.
  This is mostly for testing or post mortem analysis in case something went wrong.


## Real-time (online) mode

Picks are received as they are sent by the real-time picker.
The picker can be the standard SeisComP scautopick or any other picker.
We are currently testing it online for a network in northern Chile and it works well.

Invocation can be as simple as
```
seiscomp exec scoctoloc \
	--center-latlon -22,-70 \
	--pick-authors 'dlpicker' \
	--debug
```
to use picks generated by 'dlpicker' for a network centered at 22°S, 70°W.

This is work in progress.
Many features are missing and some config parameters are still hard coded.
Stay tuned.


## Offline mode

We need an inventory and the parametric data, both as SeisComP XML files.

An example call might look like this

```
seiscomp exec scoctoloc \
	--inventory-xml inventory.xml \
	--input-xml gfz2024tdcj.xml \
	--whitelist whitelist.txt \
	--center-latlon -22,-70 \
	--output-xml output.xml \
	--debug
```

Pretty self-explaining so far.
The whitelist contains a list of network and station codes to filter against, in order to only work with a specific subset of the data.
The network center latitude and longitude define the projection center of out network.


## Playback (real-time simulation) mode

You can try it out like in the offline example above by simply adding the `--playback` option.


# Tests

Work in progress.


# Issues

* See [this issue on Github](https://github.com/yetinam/pyocto/issues/21).
  This is the reason why we have to `import pyrocko.modelling` before any SeisComP imports until a better solution is found.
* A lot more configuration options need to be added.
